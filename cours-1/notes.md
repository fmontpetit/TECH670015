    ##### Digital Innovation as a Fundamental and Powerful Concept in the Information Systems Curriculum

    Définitions diverses

        We define digital innovation quite broadly as a product,
        process, or business model that is perceived as new, requires some significant changes on the part of adopters, and is embodied in or enabled by IT.

        *** We should note that the IT artifact is a critical element in our definition of digital innovation. ***

        “an idea, practice or object that is perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption” 

        “it matters little, so far as human behavior is concerned, whether or not an idea is objectively new as measured by the lapse of time since its first use or discovery”

    Digital Process Innovations

        significantly new (from the perspective of the adopter) ways of doing things in an organizational setting that are embodied in or enabled by 
        IT 
    
    Digital Product and Business Model Innovations

        significantly new (from the perspective of a particular community or market) products or services that are either embodied in IT or enabled 
        by IT

        significantly new way of creating and capturing business value that is embodied in or enabled by IT.
