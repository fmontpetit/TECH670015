* ### Qu’est ce qu’une innovation disruptive (disruptive innovation)? Expliquer en quoi consiste la théorie de la disruption de Christensen. Quel est le but de son article de 2015?

    #### Notes de lecture

    “Disruption” describes a process whereby a smaller company with fewer resources is able to successfully challenge established incumbent businesses. 

    as incumbents focus on improving their products and services for their most demanding (and usually most profitable) customers, they exceed the needs of some segments and ignore the needs of others

    more-suitable functionality—frequently at a lower price. 

    Entrants that prove disruptive begin by successfully targeting those overlooked segments, 

    Entrants then move upmarket, delivering the performance that incumbents’ mainstream customers require, while preserving the advantages that drove their early success. When mainstream customers start adopting the entrants’ offerings in volume, disruption has occurred

    Elle semble vouloir s'assurer que la définition actuelle de l'innovation distruptive est bien comprise, car plusieurs l'utilise à leur sauce sans bien être sûr de ce que c'est ou n'ont pas suivi les développement de la théorie

    an effort to capture the state of the art.

 * ### Qui est Jean-Marie DRU? Pourquoi est-il concerné par l’article de Christensen?  Quel est son point de vue et son argument sur la question de la disruption?  

    #### Notes de lecture
    
    chairman of TBWA\Worldwide. He is the inventor of the Disruption methodology, which was launched in 1992. He has published several books on the subject, namely Disruption (John Wiley & Sons, 1996), Beyond Disruption (John Wiley & Sons, 2002), and How Disruption Brought Order (Palgrave Macmillan, 2007)

    Christensen’s definition of disruption is clearly too narrow.

    Disruption refers to everything that is not gradual change.

    We also need to fight against the widely held view that disruption is destruction.

    In truth, a whole range of strategies is available, so that corporations can improve market share by adopting a disruptive approach, without going so far as destroying their marketplace.
